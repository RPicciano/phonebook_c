# Basic User Database Program In C

Please remember that the executable is a product of the main.c code, and that if you download these files you will need to change some things to be specific to your machine. Specifically, you will need to set
the exact path to users.txt in _ALL_ fopen() instances. Otherwise, you will get a segmentation fault error. 

This program does two basic (yet important) tasks:

1. Reads all text from a text file, stores it and parses it to make it usable.
2. Writes new data immediately to the file (I.e., after entering new information, you will not have to wait until the script is over to view the changes), and properly formats for the next anticipated input.



This program is very simple, and I acknowledge (as a beginner to programming) that there are areas to my code that could be improved. 
That being said, any and all feedback is appreciated. 

If you are a fellow beginner, please read the below:



# **_Important_**


This C file was built on MacOS; meaning, that the executable in the ‘bin’ folder will not be runnable on windows. For fellow Linux users, you should encounter no issues.

That being said, windows users may simply rebuild the C file on their own. Please take into account the following: very simple lines of code in this script are specific to MacOS and Linux. For example: system(“clear”) can _only_ be used on a Mac and Linux machine. Thus, look around for the alternative lines of code to accomplish the same task, and rebuild.

Finally, the C file is fully commented with explanations to my best ability.
